# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather application that gets data from open weather map api and renders them
for the user to easily see the current weather and the weather for the next five
days. This application utilizes react, react hooks, localstorage, and axios to render data and
show the data in a way that can be easily understood. 

React and react hooks are
both used to make component and individually update and render their rescpet
data. In total there are five major components where they get data and render
the data. Lastly, axios is used to get the data from open weather map api for
most major cities. There are two main api calls, first the current weather of
the city, then the forcast of the city. Both of api calls are use for the
current city searched or clicked on. Lastly, Every city searched is saved to the
localstroage of the web broswer where it is accessed for later or to keep track
of what buttons there are.

## Usage 

A user is able to access the webpage throught
https://weather-dash-015.herokuapp.com/ which is hosted using heroku. If teh
user has not entered a city before they will be shown an empty page where most
of the data is shown. On the top left of the page the user is able to type a
city and press the search button to see the current weather and forcast. The
user is also able to view the small history of cities searched on the left and
are able to click on those cities which will show the user the data for that
city pressed.
